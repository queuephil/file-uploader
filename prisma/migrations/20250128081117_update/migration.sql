  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `File` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `File` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The `folderId` column on the `File` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `Folder` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `Folder` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The `parentId` column on the `Folder` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `Session` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `Session` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
